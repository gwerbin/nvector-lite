v0.2.0
======

API
---
* Removed automatic "double broadcasting" from cross-track distance; users can do it themselves now.
* Correctly implemented both cross-track and along-track distances

Documentation
----
* Update and expand main docstring.
* Add warnings about non-unit vector inputs and antipodal points.
* Clarify nvector -> longitude conversion behavior at poles.
* Moved examples/ into the test suite for now.
* Updated developer instructions in Readme.

Tests
-----
* Split tests into "API" and "internal" suites.

Development environment
-----------------------
* Added more Hatch helper scripts.
* Added an IPython startup script with hot reloading.
* Switched to UV

Internal
--------
* Switch to an even-more-stable arc angle formula.
* Refactored usage of _validate() and _promote_shape().
* Used internal helper functions in more places instead of "raw" Numpy funcs.
* Removed unnecessary keepdims=True usage in normalize().
* Improved normalize() performance with in-place operations, and optional out= kwarg.
* Improved type hints.
* Renamed _dot_1d() to _dot_1d_scalar() and replaced np.dot() with less-ambiguous np.inner().
