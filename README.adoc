= N-vector Lite

== About

N-vector Lite is a simple, flexible, and permissively-licensed implementation
of the https://www.ffi.no/en/research/n-vector["n-vector" horizontal position
system] in Python and Numpy. It is currently **alpha quality**.

Note that this project is developed/maintained as a side project in my spare
time. See `+LICENSE.txt+` for license terms, including a total disclaimer of
warranty. Contributions of bugfixes and features are accepted, but I make no
promises about the timeliness of my response.

For an explanation of the n-vector system, refer to the `+nvector_lite.py+` docstring.

This library is designed to work with arbitrary-shape/size Numpy arrays. By
comparison, the original https://pypi.org/project/nvector[nvector]
implementation has inconsistent and unclear support for arrays of multiple
points, i.e. anything other than shape `+(3, 1)+`.

N-vector Lite is meant to be useful for "batch" computation over datasets of
points stored in Numpy arrays, Pandas data frames, etc. â€” with much faster
performance than you would be able to achieve with the original `+nvector+`
library.

This is also useful for SQL-like database/query engines that support
batched/vectorized Python UDFs, such as PySpark, DuckDB, and Snowflake.

== Installation

I will set up PyPI publishing and a stable versioning scheme eventually.
For now, install https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/#git[directly from Git using Pip]:

[,shell]
----
pip install git+https://github.com/gwerbin/nvector-lite
----

== Development

Development requires https://hatch.pypa.io/[Hatch].

First, clone the Git repository.

Then, set up our Hatch environments:

[,shell]
----
hatch python install all
hatch env create dev
----

Technically this is optional and will be done automatically by `+hatch run+`.
But it's nice to have everything set up and ready to avoid a long wait for the
first command.

Run tests:

[,shell]
----
hatch run dev:pytest
----
