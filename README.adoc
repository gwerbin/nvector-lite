= N-vector Lite

== About

N-vector Lite is a simple, flexible, and permissively-licensed implementation
of the https://www.ffi.no/en/research/n-vector["n-vector" horizontal position
system] in Python and Numpy. It is currently **alpha quality**.

Note that this project is developed/maintained as a side project in my spare
time. See `+LICENSE.txt+` for license terms, including a total disclaimer of
warranty. Contributions of bugfixes/corrections, features, tests, and
documentation are accepted, but I make no promises about the timeliness of my
response.

For an explanation of the n-vector system and additional design details, refer
to the `+nvector_lite.py+` docstring.
I have no plans to support non-spherical Earth models for the time being, in
part because the math is beyond me and in part because I want to focus on the
core feature set first.

This library is designed to work with arbitrary-shape/size Numpy arrays. By
comparison, the original https://pypi.org/project/nvector[nvector]
implementation has inconsistent and unclear support for arrays of multiple
points, i.e. anything other than shape `+(3, 1)+`.

N-vector Lite is meant to be useful for "batch" computation over datasets of
points stored in Numpy arrays, Pandas data frames, etc. â€” with much faster
performance than you would be able to achieve with the original `+nvector+`
library.

This is also useful for SQL-like database/query engines that support
batched/vectorized Python UDFs, such as PySpark, DuckDB, and Snowflake.

=== Features

In progress or completed:

* N-vector operations:
  * Conversion from lon,lat to n-vector
  * Conversion from n-vector to lon,lat
  * Unit normal vector of the great circle formed by two n-vectors
  * Arc angle between two n-vectors
  * Interpolation along the great circle arc between two n-vectors
  * "Direct"/"forward" geodesic problem: obtain a new n-vector from a starting point, distance, and azimuth
  * Intersection n-vector between two arcs formed by two pairs of n-vectors
  * Cross-track arc angle of an n-vector with respect to the great circle arc between two n-vectors
  * Along-track arc angle of an n-vector with respect to the great circle arc between two n-vectors
  * Check if a polygon of n-vectors contains the North Pole or South Pole
* Extensive test coverage

Planned:

* More n-vector operations
* More test coverage
* Continuous integration
* Distribution and automation thereof:
  * PyPI
  * Conda Forge
* Documentation:
  * Tutorials / usage guides
  * API reference
  * Usage comparison with other implementations
* Benchmark suite, including comparison with other implementations


== Installation

I will set up PyPI publishing and a stable versioning scheme eventually.
For now, install https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/#git[directly from Git using Pip]:

[,shell]
----
pip install git+https://github.com/gwerbin/nvector-lite
----


== Usage

=== Examples

Refer to the test suite, especially any test called `+test_example+`.


== Development

Development requires https://hatch.pypa.io/[Hatch].

Then, just clone the Git repository. Hatch will automatically set up the project environment
when you run a command for the first time.

Run tests:

[,shell]
----
hatch run dev:pytest
----

Run an interactive Python console with hot-reloading enabled:

[,shell]
----
hatch run dev:repl
----

Run any other command (e.g. Python) in the dev environment:

[,shell]
----
hatch run dev:python ...
hatch run dev:python -m pdb ...
hatch run dev:/bin/sh ...
watch -n 60 hatch run dev:pytest -k test_example
----
